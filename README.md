# Active-Air-Sampler

This is the microcontroller code for the Active Air Sampler.  In brief, an Arduino Nano was used to control the sampling rate and sampling volume/time of a SPME Active Air Sampler while also monitoring the battery voltage.  More information can be found in the journal article:  Alexander G. Fung, Mei S. Yamaguchi, Mitchell M. McCartney, Alexander A. Aksenov, Alberto Pasamontes, Cristina E. Davis,"SPME-based mobile field device for active sampling of volatiles", Microchemical Journal, Vo 146, 2019,Pages 407-413
